*Logo: A sleek, futuristic design with glowing text "R3DLY-D34DLY" and a radar-like animation.*

R3DLY-D34DLY is a powerful and efficient Go-based tool designed for passive scanning of IP addresses and domains. It leverages Shodan and IPInfo APIs to gather detailed information about IPs, including hostnames, geolocation, open ports, and vulnerabilities. The tool is ideal for security researchers, network administrators, and anyone interested in IP intelligence.

---

## Features

- **IP Scanning**: Scan single IPs, lists of IPs, or IPs from a file.
- **Domain Resolution**: Resolve domains and scan associated IPs.
- **API Integration**: Fetch data from Shodan and IPInfo APIs.
- **Concurrency**: Limit concurrent scans for efficient resource usage.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retry failed API requests.
- **Private IP Filtering**: Exclude private IP addresses from results.
- **User-Agent Randomization**: Randomize User-Agent headers to avoid detection.
- **Formatted Output**: Display results in a clean, color-coded table.
- **Output to File**: Save results to a file for later analysis.

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument           | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-ip`              | Scan a single IP address (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).                                |
| `-list`            | Scan a comma-separated list of IPs (e.g., `8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1`).              |
| `-file`            | Scan IPs from a file (e.g., `ips.txt`).                                    |
| `-domain`          | Resolve a domain and scan associated IPs (e.g., `example.com`).            |
| `-output`          | Save results to a file (e.g., `results.txt`).                              |
| `-retry-attempts`  | Set the number of retry attempts for failed requests (default: `5`).       |
| `-retry-wait`      | Set the wait time between retry attempts (default: `2s`).                  |
| `-concurrency`     | Set the number of concurrent scans (default: `10`).                        |

### Examples

1. **Scan a Single IP**:
   ```bash
   ./r3dly-d34dly -ip 8.8.8.8
   ```

2. **Scan a List of IPs**:
   ```bash
   ./r3dly-d34dly -list "8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1"
   ```

3. **Scan IPs from a File**:
   ```bash
   ./r3dly-d34dly -file ips.txt
   ```

4. **Scan IPs Associated with a Domain**:
   ```bash
   ./r3dly-d34dly -domain example.com
   ```

5. **Save Results to a File**:
   ```bash
   ./r3dly-d34dly -ip 8.8.8.8 -output results.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### IPInfo API Key
To use the IPInfo API, you need an API key. Save your key in a file at `/opt/.ipinfo.api`:
```bash
echo "your_api_key_here" > /opt/.ipinfo.api
```
